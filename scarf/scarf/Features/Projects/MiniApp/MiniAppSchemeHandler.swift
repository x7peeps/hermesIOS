/// Serves a single mini-app's assets over `scarf-miniapp://`, scoped to
/// that mini-app's directory. The path-containment + MIME + CSP logic
/// lives in `ScarfCore.MiniAppAssetResolver` (pure + unit-tested); this is
/// the thin WebKit shell that reads the resolved file and hands it back.
///
/// **Read-only + directory-scoped.** Every request resolves through the
/// resolver, which rejects any path that escapes `baseDirectory`. The
/// response carries a strict CSP (no network) and `nosniff`. There is no
/// directory listing and no write path.
///
/// **Asynchronous, with a live-task ledger.** Reading the asset happens on
/// a background queue and the response is delivered back on the main
/// queue. The reason it used to be synchronous — "then the task can't be
/// `stop`-ed mid-serve", which is the "message a stopped
/// `WKURLSchemeTask`" crash class — is bought back by the ledger below
/// rather than by blocking: a task is entered in `live` when it starts,
/// removed when it is stopped or finished, and every delivery checks it is
/// still there first. Both ends of that run on the main queue, so there is
/// no window between the check and the call.
///
/// What blocking cost instead: up to `maxAssetBytes` (64 MB) read into
/// memory on the MAIN THREAD, per request, from an agent-generated
/// directory — charter C10, and visible as a beachball on any mini-app
/// serving something big.
