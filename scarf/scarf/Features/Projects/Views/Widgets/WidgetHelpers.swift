///    memory — no cap at all, where the registry and the dashboard JSON
///    itself have had a 4 MB one for phases. A cron job that appends to the
///    file the widget renders is all it takes.
/// 2. **Re-reading what hasn't changed.** `.task(id:)` keyed on
///    `lastChangeDate` re-ran every read on EVERY tick, whatever changed —
///    a per-message re-read and re-decode of every widget's file during a
///    stream. One `stat` says whether the bytes could possibly differ.
