/// against a **profile-pinned** `ServerContext`, so the entire main-Chat
/// stack — streaming tokens, thinking, tool cards, permission prompts,
/// slash commands, history hydration — comes along unchanged, but every
/// path it touches (the ACP subprocess, `state.db`, session attribution)
/// resolves inside the bot's own profile directory.
///
/// Two things make it "the bot's" conversation rather than a chat that
/// happens to be pointed elsewhere:
/// 1. the ACP process is launched as `hermes -p <bot> acp`, so the agent
///    on the other end has the bot's SOUL, skills, memory and credentials;
/// 2. the session opened is the one titled exactly `"Bot Chat"` in that
///    profile's `state.db` — the only title for which Hermes injects the
///    bot-mode teammate protocol (`agent/system_prompt.py:737-747`).
///
/// **Two transports, decided by the session's birth** (see ``Delivery``):
/// Hermes' ACP adapter only restores sessions with `source == "acp"`
/// (`acp_adapter/session.py:527`), so the streaming stack above applies
/// only to an ACP-born Bot Chat. The canonical Bot Chat is almost never
/// that — Scarf creates it over the CLI, Hermes Desktop over the gateway —
/// so the common case converses over the CLI transport with `state.db`
/// hydration instead: honest, un-streamed, and in the real Bot Chat.

    /// it is reachable only from the gateway/REST layer. Scarf will not
    /// write to `state.db` to close the gap; it is read-only, and this is a
    /// row Hermes owns. The consequence is cosmetic and bounded: the chat
    /// is correctly titled (so the protocol injects and every other surface
    /// resolves it), but it also appears in the Sessions list *of this bot's
    /// own profile* (that is where its `state.db` lives — it does NOT appear
    /// under whatever profile the window is otherwise scoped to), and it is
    /// renameable there.

    /// A rename WOULD orphan it: `SessionDB._set_session_title` (:10210)
    /// refuses the rename only for a session that is both titled "Bot Chat"
    /// AND hidden, so the server-side guard never fires for a Scarf-created
    /// one. Both of Scarf's rename paths — `SessionsViewModel.confirmRename`
    /// and `ChatSessionListPane.commitRename` — therefore raise a
