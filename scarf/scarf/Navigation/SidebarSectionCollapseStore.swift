/// screen. `UserDefaults` is therefore the right home — no Keychain, no
/// integrity MAC, and a corrupted/absent value simply falls back to the
/// per-section default below.
///
/// One key per section title (`sidebar.section.collapsed.<Title>`)
/// rather than one array of collapsed titles: sections are
/// capability-gated and appear/disappear as the window's Hermes host
/// changes, so "absent" has to keep meaning "use this section's
/// default" — with a single blob, a section the user has never seen
/// would inherit whatever the blob happened to say.
///
/// Shared app-wide (not per-window): the collapse state is a preference
/// about the chrome, and two windows on the same Mac disagreeing about
/// whether Configure is open reads as a bug.
