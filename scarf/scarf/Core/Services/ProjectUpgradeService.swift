/// skill. **Fleet is out of scope** for upgrade.
///
/// **Invariants.** Every step is idempotent and BOUNDED — it never clobbers
/// user content outside managed markers, and never overwrites a real
/// `dashboard.json`. It is SECRET-SAFE (touches no secret values). The only
/// step that can abort the whole run is the identity write (`project.json`):
/// without a stable id nothing else is meaningful, and an id minted *after*
/// id-keyed facets would orphan them. Everything after identity is
/// best-effort + logged (NON-FATAL) so one facet failing doesn't sink the
/// upgrade. Re-running on an already-upgraded project is a no-op.
