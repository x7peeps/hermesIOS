/// single `StatsClient`. Call sites keep calling `Analytics.record(...)`;
/// tests call ``install(_:)`` to swap the tracker underneath.
///
/// Everything here is `nonisolated` and fire-and-forget: `record(_ event:)` —
/// which takes a ``UsageEvent``, the closed set that *is* the taxonomy — is
/// the one entry point the rest of the app uses, and it never suspends, never
/// touches disk on the caller's thread and never throws. If the client cannot
/// be constructed — a malformed endpoint, or a missing/unexpanded write key in
/// the bundle's Info.plist — the facade degrades to a no-op: analytics must
/// never be able to fail a launch.
///
/// Props discipline (see documents/analytics/swift-stats-adoption-event-taxonomy.md):
/// snake_case event names, flat props, **no** free text, file paths, URLs,
/// hostnames or identifiers. Durations and counts go in as coarse bucket
/// strings. Nothing in this file reads user content, and callers must not pass
/// any.
///
/// `nonisolated` in full: the app target defaults new declarations to
/// `@MainActor`, and analytics must be callable from any isolation without a
/// hop — an inherited `@MainActor` on the tracker would make `record()` from a
/// background context a hard error under the Swift 6 language mode.
