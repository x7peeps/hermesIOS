/// this template" would be a worse first-run experience than today's.
/// Bootstrapping it from the app bundle decouples the skill's
/// availability from any one template install.
///
/// **What gets bootstrapped.** Every subdirectory of
/// `Bundle.main/Resources/Skills/` is treated as one skill (its name
/// is the directory name). Currently that's just
/// `scarf-template-author`; future built-in skills can drop their dir
