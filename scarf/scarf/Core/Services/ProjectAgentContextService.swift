/// Writes a Scarf-managed marker block into `<project>/AGENTS.md` so
/// that Hermes — which auto-reads `AGENTS.md` from the process cwd
/// at startup — has consistent project identity and metadata in every
/// project-scoped chat.
///
/// **Why this exists.** Hermes has no native "project" concept and ACP
/// passes only `(cwd, mcpServers)` at session create — extra params
/// are silently dropped on Hermes's side. The documented hook for
/// giving the agent context when cwd is set programmatically is the
/// auto-load of `AGENTS.md` (or `.hermes.md` / `CLAUDE.md` /
/// `.cursorrules`, in that priority) from the cwd. Scarf owns a
/// managed region of the project's AGENTS.md; template-author content
/// lives outside that region and is preserved.
///
/// **Marker contract.** The region sits between:
///
/// ```
/// <!-- scarf-project:begin -->
/// …Scarf-managed content…
/// <!-- scarf-project:end -->
/// ```
///
/// Same pattern as the v2.2 memory-block appendix — bounded, self-
/// declaring, safe to re-generate. Everything outside the markers is
/// left byte-identical across refreshes.
///
/// **Secret-safe.** The block surfaces field NAMES from `config.json`
/// (via the cached manifest's schema) but never VALUES. A rendered
/// block contains no secrets even for a project whose config.json
/// has Keychain-ref URIs.
///
/// **Refresh timing.** `ChatViewModel.startACPSession(resume:projectPath:)`
/// calls `refresh(for:)` immediately before Hermes opens the session.
/// Hermes reads AGENTS.md during session boot, so the marker block
/// must have landed on disk first. Non-blocking on failure — a
/// failed refresh logs and the chat proceeds without the block.
///
/// **Rendering is shared.** Block construction lives in ScarfCore's
/// `ProjectStore.renderAgentContextBlock` / `ProjectContextBlock` so the
/// Mac and ScarfGo (iOS) emit byte-identical blocks for identical
/// on-disk state — honoring the cross-platform marker invariant. This
/// service is the Mac-side persistence wrapper around that renderer.
