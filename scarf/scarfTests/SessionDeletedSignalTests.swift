/// Coverage for the cross-feature session-delete seam (t-5f1d9008):
///
/// The Sessions tab (`SessionsViewModel.confirmDelete`) is an
/// independent delete surface with no reference to the window's
/// `ChatViewModel`. Pre-fix, deleting the chat-ATTACHED session there
/// ran the CLI delete and nothing else — the `hermes acp` client kept
/// running against the deleted session: orphaned in-flight turn plus a
/// leaked process (the leak shape t-01bd55ec fixed for the chat
/// sidebar's own delete path). Post-fix, `confirmDelete` broadcasts
/// `SessionDeletedSignal` after a successful CLI delete — and so does
/// `ChatViewModel.deleteSession` (wave-1 audit: another window's chat
/// sidebar is just as much an independent delete surface). Each
/// window's ChatViewModel filters by full session id + session-STORE
/// identity (`ServerContext.id` AND `paths.home` — multi-server
/// windows; profile scoping re-points the home while keeping the
/// `ServerID`; cosmetic context fields like `displayName` must NOT
/// veto a teardown), running the same teardown as `deleteSession` on
/// a match.
///
/// ACP plumbing is scripted through the `acpClientFactory` seam and the
/// CLI through `sessionDeleteRunner` — no subprocess, no real Hermes.
/// Reuses `ChatViewModelStartLifecycleTests`' scripted channel/helpers.
