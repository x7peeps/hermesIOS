// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// Platform-neutral core for the Scarf app family (macOS and iOS).
//
// `ScarfCore` holds types that do not depend on AppKit, UIKit, or any
// platform-specific system service. The macOS and iOS app targets each link
// this package and provide their own platform shells (Sparkle + SwiftTerm on
// macOS; Citadel-based SSH transport on iOS).
//
// Minimums are chosen to match the Mac app (macOS 14.6) and the locked
// v1 iOS decision (iOS 18). Raising iOS later is free; lowering is not —
// the ViewModels on `@Observable` / `NavigationStack` are iOS 17+ features
// and we standardize on iOS 18 for feature parity with the Mac codebase.
