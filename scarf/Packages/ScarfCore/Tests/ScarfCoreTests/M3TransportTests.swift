/// Exercises M3's changes to the `ServerTransport` surface: the new
/// `streamLines(_:args:)` method, the platform-gated `makeProcess`,
/// the `ServerContext.sshTransportFactory` injection point, and the
/// HermesLogService refactor that drives remote tailing through
/// `streamLines` instead of a raw `Process` + `Pipe`.
///
/// **`.serialized` is mandatory.** Several tests set the static
/// `ServerContext.sshTransportFactory` + restore in `defer`. Running
/// them in parallel (swift-testing's default) makes the factory a
/// race hazard — one test's scripted transport gets read by the
/// other, producing confusing "wrong log line" failures.

    // v2.5. Co-locating them eliminates the cross-suite race we hit during
    // pre-release verification: M3 + M5 each held `.serialized` internally
    // but ran in parallel with each other, clobbering the static. The tests
    // themselves are unchanged in shape, just relocated.
