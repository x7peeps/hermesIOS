///   cloud:
///     url: https://hermes.example.com

/// `note` is optional (omitted entirely when `--note` wasn't given).
/// Hand-written flow style (`spark: {url: ..., note: ...}`) is picked up
/// too, since `HermesYAML` records both block and flow maps under the
/// same `maps` path.
///
/// **No key is ever read.** The peer's `API_SERVER_KEY` lives in
/// `~/.hermes/.env`, not here, and Scarf does not go looking for it.
///
/// ## Only `url` and `note` are read
/// A long `--note` is line-folded by PyYAML on the way out, and its
/// continuation lines can contain arbitrary text — including something
/// that reads like `url: http://decoy`. `HermesYAML` now recognizes those
/// continuations by indent and drops them, but this reader stays narrow as
/// a second line of defence: it consults exactly the two keys it knows and
/// ignores every other key under a peer entry, so a note can never
/// contribute a field it isn't supposed to own.
