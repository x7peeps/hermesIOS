/// that remain **must** be answered, and answered by position.
///
/// Scarf previously piped a blanket `"y\ny\ny\n"` at every add. For a
/// plain HTTP server that is actively harmful: the first `y` accepts
/// "Does this server require authentication?", and the second `y` is
/// then read as the **API key** and written to `~/.hermes/.env` as
/// `MCP_<NAME>_API_KEY`, with `Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_<NAME>_API_KEY}`
/// stamped into config.yaml. (The read goes through `masked_secret_prompt`,
/// which falls back to `getpass` on a non-tty stdin, and `getpass` falls
/// back to reading stdin when there is no controlling terminal — which is
/// exactly a GUI-launched app.) The rules below follow from that:
///
/// 1. Never send a bare `y` where the CLI reads a *value*.
/// 2. Prefer an empty line: every prompt's default is the outcome Scarf
///    wants, except the auth question, whose default is *yes*.
