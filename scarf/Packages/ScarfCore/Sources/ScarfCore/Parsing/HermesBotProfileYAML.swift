/// Reader **and** surgical writer for `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml` — the file
/// that carries a Hermes profile's Bot Mode identity.
///
/// ## Why a direct file write, and not the CLI
///
/// `hermes profile` has no verb that touches `ui_meta`. Verified against the
/// audited tag (v2026.8.31 / Hermes 0.21.0): `hermes_cli/subcommands/profile.py`
/// registers `list / use / create / delete / describe / show / alias / rename /
/// export / import / install / update / info`, and the only writer of
/// profile.yaml on the CLI side is `hermes_cli/profiles.write_profile_meta`
/// (:951-991), whose entire keyword surface is `description`,
/// `description_auto`, and `display_name`. There is no `ui_meta` argument
/// anywhere in the subcommand tree. So for the bot block a direct file write
/// is the only mechanism available to a CLI-driven client.
///
/// ## The CAS-bypass caveat (read this before adding a writer call site)
///
/// The Hermes **desktop** does not write this file directly either — it goes
/// through the gateway RPC `profiles.configure`, which keeps a per-key
/// revision counter in `_ui_meta_revisions` and rejects a stale write
/// (`tui_gateway/methods_profiles.py:436-477` @ `v2026.9.7` —
/// `_configure_ui_meta`, CAS check at `:445-460`, revision bump at `:468`
/// and write-back at `:473`; compare-and-swap semantics
/// pinned by `tests/tui_gateway/test_profiles_ui_meta_cas.py`). Scarf's direct
/// write has **no such interlock**: if Hermes Desktop edits the same bot
/// between Scarf's read and Scarf's write, Scarf wins and the desktop's edit
/// is lost (and vice versa — Scarf does not bump `_ui_meta_revisions`, so a
/// desktop client will not notice that the value changed underneath it).
///
/// This is an accepted, bounded risk for a single-user tool editing its own
/// bots, but it is a real one:
/// - Read immediately before writing; never write from a roster snapshot that
///   has been sitting in a view model.
/// - Never write on a timer, on focus change, or as a side effect of merely
///   *displaying* a bot. Only an explicit user save.
/// - If Scarf ever speaks the gateway control socket, move this write to
///   `profiles.configure` with `ui_meta_expected_revisions` and delete the
///   direct path.
///
/// ## Preservation contract
///
/// Bytes outside the three regions Scarf edits — the top-level `display_name`
/// / `description` / `description_auto` scalars and the
/// `ui_meta:` → `hermes-bots:` subtree — are left untouched, including
/// comments, key order, blank lines, and the file's line-ending flavor. Inside
/// the `hermes-bots` block, keys Scarf models are re-emitted in a stable order
/// and everything else rides along verbatim in
/// ``HermesBotIdentity/unknownMetaLines``. That is strictly more conservative
/// than Hermes' own writer, which `safe_load`s and `safe_dump`s the whole file
/// and drops every comment in it.
///
/// **Two documented exceptions, both confined to the managed block.**
/// 1. *Blank lines inside `hermes-bots:` are not preserved.* Modeled keys are
///    re-emitted in a stable order and unknown keys are appended after them,
///    so a blank line's position no longer means anything once the block is
///    rewritten; keeping it would move it somewhere it wasn't. Blank lines
///    everywhere ELSE in the file — including between `ui_meta`'s children —
///    are untouched, and the block's own trailing blank line is left outside
///    the replaced range.
/// 2. *Key order inside `hermes-bots:` is not preserved* (see
///    ``renderBotMeta`` for why no consumer depends on it).
///
/// The writer **refuses** (returns `nil`) rather than guessing whenever the
/// file is in a shape it cannot edit safely — see ``write(identity:into:)``.
