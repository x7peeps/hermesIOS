/// Top-level manifest for a `.scarfbackup` archive.
///
/// **Archive layout** (`.scarfbackup` is a plain ZIP):
/// ```
/// <name>.scarfbackup
/// ├── manifest.json           — this struct, JSON-encoded
/// ├── hermes.tar.gz            — gzipped tar of `~/.hermes/` (minus exclusions)
/// └── projects/
///     ├── <project-id>.tar.gz — one inner tarball per registered project
///     └── ...
/// ```
///
/// **Why two layers (outer ZIP + inner tarballs).** The inner tarballs are
/// produced by streaming `tar -czf - …` over SSH — that's the only way to
/// keep memory bounded for multi-GB hermes homes. The outer ZIP exists so
/// the manifest sits at a fixed, easy-to-inspect location and so users on
/// macOS can double-click in Finder and see the structure. ZIP also has a
/// central directory at the end, which makes "validate without extracting"
/// cheap.
///
/// **What rides along.** Hermes home (state.db + sessions + skills + cron +
/// memories + scarf sidecars + plugins/profiles), each project's full file
/// tree (the user's code), and the manifest itself. **What does NOT ride
/// along by default**: `auth.json` (provider credentials), `mcp-tokens/`
/// (per-host OAuth bearer tokens), `logs/` (size, low restore value),
/// `state.db-wal` / `state.db-shm` (in-flight WAL siblings — we checkpoint
/// before the archive). The `options` block records exactly which
/// exclusions were applied so the restore flow can warn the user.
