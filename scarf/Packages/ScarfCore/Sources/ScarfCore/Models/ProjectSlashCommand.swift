///
/// The command is invoked via the chat slash menu like any other command,
/// but Scarf intercepts the invocation client-side: the body is treated as
/// a prompt template (with `{{argument}}` substitution from whatever
/// followed the slash), expanded to a regular user prompt, and sent to
/// Hermes as a normal message. The agent never sees the slash trigger;
/// it sees the expanded prompt prefixed with a `<!-- scarf-slash:<name> -->`
/// marker so it can correlate.
///
/// **Why client-side expansion.** Hermes has no project-scoped slash
/// command concept. Doing the substitution in Scarf means commands work
/// uniformly on Mac + iOS, local + remote SSH transports, against any
/// Hermes version (no upstream dependency).
