/// Where an effective per-bot setting actually comes from.
///
/// **The layering verdict (source-verified at Hermes v2026.8.31 / 0.21.0).**
/// A Hermes profile does **not** inherit the root profile's `config.yaml` at
/// runtime. `_load_config_impl` (`hermes_cli/config.py:2178-2260` @ v2026.9.7 — P39
/// re-anchored this from `:3936-4080`) builds the
/// effective config from exactly three layers:
///
///   1. `DEFAULT_CONFIG` — Hermes' built-in schema defaults.
///   2. `get_config_path()` → `<HERMES_HOME>/config.yaml`, deep-merged on top.
///   3. the managed scope (`/etc/hermes/config.yaml`), merged last and winning
///      at the leaf.
///
/// `HERMES_HOME` under `hermes -p <bot>` is `<root>/profiles/<bot>`
/// (`_apply_profile_override`, `hermes_cli/main.py:521-724`, which rewrites the
/// env var *before* argparse and strips `-p` from argv). So layer 2 is the
/// **bot's own** file and the root's `config.yaml` is never consulted — profiles
/// are independent islands. The only relationship is a one-time COPY at
/// creation: `create_profile` clones config files with `--clone`, and a
/// clone-less create runs `_seed_model_config` (`profiles.py:773-805`), which
/// copies the active profile's `model:` block into the new file once. Editing
/// either afterwards never touches the other.
///
/// The UI consequence — and the reason this type exists — is that a bot's
/// unpinned key falls back to **Hermes' built-in default**, never to "whatever
/// the root profile says". Rendering the root's value as an inherited default
/// would be a lie, so ``BotAgentConfigService`` deliberately does not read the
/// root's `config.yaml` at all.
