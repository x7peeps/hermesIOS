/// **Source of truth:** hermes-agent `gateway/profile_routing.py` at tag
/// v2026.8.3 (v0.20.0) — `ProfileRoute` (line 50), `parse_profile_routes`
/// (line 105) — and `docs/profile-routing.md`. The routing feature first
/// shipped in commit 5e65f6d79f "feat(gateway): add profile-based routing
/// for inbound messages" (2026-06-27), first released in tag v2026.7.20 =
/// **Hermes 0.19.0** — hence the `isV019OrLater` floor, not v0.20.
///
/// **Matching is conjunctive.** Every discriminator the rule declares must
/// hold (`matches`, profile_routing.py:74-102): `platform` must be equal,
/// `thread_id` (if set) equal, `guild_id` (if set) equal, and `chat_id` (if
/// set) must equal either the source channel *or* its parent (so a route on
/// a channel also catches threads/forum posts inside it). A field left
/// unset is not a constraint — and because Python treats `""` as falsy in
/// those `if self.<field>` guards, an empty string is *also* "unset". Scarf
/// still omits empty fields from the YAML rather than writing `''`, so the
/// file says exactly what it means.
///
/// **Ranking is by specificity, not list order.** `parse_profile_routes`
/// sorts most-specific-first with an additive weight (`specificity`,
/// profile_routing.py:62-72): `thread_id` 8 + `chat_id` 4 + `guild_id` 2.
/// `match_profile_route` then takes the first match in *that* order. Python's
/// `list.sort` is stable, so rules of equal specificity keep their file
/// order. Any UI must present this ranking rather than implying top-down
/// priority.
