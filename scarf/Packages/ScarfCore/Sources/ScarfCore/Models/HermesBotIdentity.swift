/// A Hermes profile's Bot Mode identity, as persisted in

///
/// **A bot IS a profile.** Bot Mode adds no store of its own: the desktop
/// plugin writes presentation metadata into the profile's `profile.yaml`
/// under `ui_meta['hermes-bots']`, alongside the two top-level keys Hermes'
/// own CLI already owns (`display_name`, `description`). A profile is
/// "bot-managed" precisely when that block is a mapping — the same test
/// `tools/bot_mode_probe.py:60-76` (`_is_bot_managed`) applies before it
/// injects the Bot Chat protocol section.
///
/// **Field set.** The typed fields mirror `BotMeta` in the desktop plugin's
/// `apps/desktop/src/plugins/hermes-bots/types.ts` — every field optional,
/// because a roster row can be produced by three different code paths and
/// older gateways omit whole keys. Two deliberate omissions:
///
/// - `image` (a data URL) is **not** modeled. The desktop strips it before
///   `profiles.configure` and ships the bytes through `profiles.set_asset`
///   instead (`tui_gateway/methods_profiles.py:1020+`), so a real installation
///   keeps its avatar in `assets/avatar.{png,jpg,webp}`, not in the YAML.
///   Where a hand-written file does carry one, it survives verbatim in
///   ``unknownMetaLines`` rather than being re-quoted by Scarf's emitter — a
///   multi-kilobyte base64 scalar is exactly the value you least want a
///   line-oriented writer to reformat.
/// - Bot Mode's group *rooms* are out of scope for Phase A, but `groups` /
///   the legacy `group` scalar are modeled because they are pure roster
///   presentation and must round-trip untouched.
///
/// **Tolerant decode.** Anything inside the `hermes-bots` block that Scarf
/// doesn't model — a newer desktop's key, an operator's comment, a nested
/// body — is captured verbatim in ``unknownMetaLines`` and re-emitted on
/// write. Scarf is a client of somebody else's file; dropping a key it merely
/// failed to recognize would be data loss.
