/// **Why a protocol instead of calling the analytics client.** `ScarfCore` is
/// shared verbatim by the macOS and iOS apps and must stay free of any
/// analytics SDK: the package links no `Stats` product, and adding one would
/// force the dependency (and its platform floor) onto every consumer. So the
/// package only ever *describes* an event; whoever hosts it decides what that
/// means. The macOS app installs a forwarder into `Analytics.record` at
/// launch. iOS installs nothing, so every call below is a nil check —
/// behavior there is bit-for-bit unchanged.
///
/// **Privacy.** `props` is `[String: String]` on purpose: bounded-cardinality
/// enum-ish tokens only. Never a hostname, username, path, error message, or
/// any other user text — the same rule the app-side facade documents. Durations
/// go through ``ScarfAnalytics/durationBucket(_:)`` rather than as numbers.
