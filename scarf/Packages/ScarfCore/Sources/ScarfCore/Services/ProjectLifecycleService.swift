/// live OUTSIDE `projects.json`.
///
/// **Why this exists.** Adding a project touches half a dozen stores; for a
/// long time removing one touched exactly one. A row deleted from the
/// registry left behind:
///
/// - the Scarf-managed AGENTS.md block, still describing the project (its
///   template, its cron ids, its slash commands) to every agent that opens
///   the folder;
/// - every mini-app permission grant the user ever approved — and because
///   project ids are DERIVED from (host, path), re-using the folder later
///   resurrects them under a new project;
/// - the project's cron jobs, still scheduled.
///
/// And archiving touched nothing at all: `archived` was a display bool the
/// sidebar filtered on while the watchers kept polling, the cron kept
/// firing, and the grants kept resolving. "Archived" said something to the
/// user that was not true of the system.
///
/// This service is the one place those transitions are spelled out, so a
/// new caller gets the whole set rather than the half it remembered.
/// Everything here is BEST-EFFORT and reports rather than throws: none of
/// it may be allowed to fail a removal the user asked for and the registry
/// already committed. What went wrong comes back as warnings the caller can
/// show or log.
