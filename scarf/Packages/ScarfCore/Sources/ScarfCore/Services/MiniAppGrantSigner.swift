/// Authenticity for `miniapp_grants.json`.
///
/// **Integrity is not authenticity.** `GuardedJSONStore` (D1) made the
/// grants file safe from Scarf's own read failures: a blip can no longer
/// blank it, corrupt bytes are quarantined, an unreadable file refuses the
/// write. None of that says anything about WHO wrote the bytes — and the
/// file lives in `~/.hermes/scarf/`, which every agent Hermes runs can
/// write. The manifest fingerprint the grant records is computed from the
/// mini-app's own `miniapp.json`, so an agent that wants `file:read`,
/// `net` and `prompt` can compute the fingerprint of the manifest it just
/// wrote, append a grant carrying it, and the launcher's
/// `hasDecision(…matching:)` check — the trust-on-first-use gate — passes
/// without a permission sheet ever appearing. The consent surface is the
/// whole security model of mini-apps; a self-servable consent record is no
/// consent record at all.
///
/// **The fix, minimally.** Each grant row carries an HMAC-SHA256 tag over
/// its own fields, keyed by a 32-byte random secret Scarf mints once and
/// keeps in the login Keychain (`com.scarf.miniapp-grants` /
/// `hmac-key-v1`). Scarf can mint the tag; an agent cannot, because the key
/// never leaves the Keychain and never appears in any file the agent can
/// read. A row whose tag is missing or wrong is DROPPED at load — not
/// refused, not repaired: dropping a grant means default-deny and the
/// permission sheet reappears, which is the safe direction and a recovery
/// the user already understands.
///
/// **Why per-row and not per-file.** A whole-file signature would make one
/// forged row invalidate every real grant the user made. Per-row means the
/// forgery is dropped and the honest decisions survive.
///
/// **What this deliberately does not defend against.** Anything that can
/// read the app's Keychain items is already inside the app's trust boundary
/// and does not need to forge a grant. And the key is per-machine: grants a
/// DIFFERENT Mac wrote into a shared remote `~/.hermes` verify as
/// unsigned, so they are dropped and re-asked on this machine. That is the
/// correct answer — a consent decision is a decision made by a person at a
/// machine, and importing another host's is exactly the trust we are
/// refusing.
/// Why a grant could not be signed. The two cases are deliberately
/// distinct: one is an environment failure the caller must refuse on, the
/// other is a row shape we will not put our name to.
