/// Cross-process advisory lock around the WHOLE read-modify-write of
/// `~/.hermes/scarf/projects.json` (t-db8c745b).
///
/// **The race it closes.** `ProjectDashboardService.saveRegistry` inspects
/// the file, refuses if it is damaged, backs it up, then publishes. Between
/// the inspect and the publish there is a window, and since the
/// `scarf-projects` MCP server shipped there are two PROCESSES in it — the
/// app and the helper Hermes spawns — plus ~6 in-app writers. Both sides
/// publish atomically, so nobody sees a torn file; the loser simply
/// disappears, and `.bak` holds the loser's state rather than the user's
/// previous one. A lock on one side only would read as safety while the
/// other side's race stayed open, which is why this is taken at the
/// chokepoint every writer already funnels through.
///
/// **Semantics — deliberately the boring ones.**
/// - **Scope: one host's local filesystem.** For a LOCAL context the lock
///   file sits beside the registry (`projects.json.lock`), so the app and
///   the MCP helper — same user, same `~/.hermes` — contend on the same
///   inode. That is the case the ticket is about: the helper resolves the
///   local home only (`scarf-projects-mcp/main.swift`) and never writes to
///   a remote host.
/// - **Remote contexts get a LOCAL lock** keyed by a digest of
///   `host|path`, in Application Support. Every writer to a remote
///   registry funnels through this app's transports, so serializing this
///   machine's writers is the whole population in practice. Two different
///   Macs writing one remote `~/.hermes` are NOT serialized — an advisory
///   file on the remote would need its own create-exclusive primitive over
///   SSH, and the stale-lock story over a flaky link is worse than the
///   race it would close. Documented rather than half-built.
/// - **Advisory, not mandatory.** Nothing stops a writer that doesn't ask.
///   Every Scarf writer does, because `saveRegistry` is the only door.
/// - **Stale locks are broken, not waited on.** A crashed holder must not
///   brick the registry: a lock whose mtime is older than ``staleAfter``
///   is removed and re-contended.
/// - **Waiting is bounded** at ``acquireTimeout``, after which
///   `registryBusy` — a failure the caller reports — beats both a frozen
///   caller (charter C10) and a silent clobber.
///
/// **Both bounds are CONTEXT-AWARE (t-07e909e0 / DI-M5).** They used to be
/// 30s and 2s flat, which are local-filesystem facts: a local registry
/// write is microseconds, so 30s means "crashed" and 2s means "wedged".
/// Applied to a REMOTE context they are simply wrong. One remote save is
/// an inspect + a `.bak` scp + a staged scp + a rename over SSH — the
/// audit measured windows around 60s on a poor link. So a legitimate
/// holder was routinely declared stale (which is how DI-H4 got its teeth:
/// its lock was broken, the successor took the lock, and the original
/// holder's `release()` then deleted the SUCCESSOR's file), and an honest
/// contender hit `registryBusy` in normal use. Remote gets
/// ``remoteStaleAfter`` (5 min — comfortably above the worst save we have
/// seen) and ``remoteAcquireTimeout`` (60s — the worst-case hold, so a
/// concurrent save waits its turn instead of reporting a fake failure).
///
/// **Why a big `staleAfter` and not a holder heartbeat.** A heartbeat
/// (the holder touching the lock's mtime every few seconds while it
/// scps) would let the stale bound stay small, but it needs a timer or a
/// thread running alongside a synchronous write, on every platform, with
/// its own teardown-on-throw story — and it writes to the lock file
/// concurrently with contenders reading it. The boring option is a bigger
/// number: no extra thread, no extra writes, nothing to leak. What it
/// costs is that a genuinely crashed remote holder wedges contenders for
/// up to 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds. That is bounded, rare, and
/// recoverable (the file is removable by hand), and the ownership token
/// below means the eventual break can no longer damage the successor.
///
/// **The lock file is AGENT-WRITABLE — it is cooperation, not integrity
/// (SEC-M5).** For a local context it sits in `~/.hermes/scarf/`, a
/// directory the agent Scarf fronts reads and writes freely. Anything
/// with write access there can create the lock and hold it (a denial of
/// service — every Scarf registry write reports `registryBusy` until the
/// staleness bound expires and breaks it), or delete a live holder's lock
/// (re-opening exactly the race this closes for one write). Neither is
/// defended against, and neither can be: an advisory file lock in a
/// directory the adversary owns is a protocol between COOPERATING
/// writers — Scarf's app process and Scarf's `scarf-projects` MCP helper
/// — and nothing more. The integrity layer against a hostile writer is
/// elsewhere and unchanged: `saveRegistry` inspects the file inside the
/// lock and REFUSES to publish over damage, over an unexpected
/// fingerprint (`expecting:`), or over a non-empty registry with an empty
/// one. Those refusals hold whether or not the lock was honoured. Read
/// this type as "two of our own processes don't stomp on each other",
/// never as "the registry cannot be corrupted".
///
/// **Who takes it (t-07e909e0 / DI-H5).** Every read-modify-write of a
/// registry-shaped file, around the WHOLE of the RMW, not just its publish:
/// `ProjectDashboardService.saveRegistry`, `ProjectStore.indexInRegistry`,
/// `ProjectDoctorService.repair` (once per repair — `repairAllSafe` does
/// NOT hold one lock across the pass, so each repair re-reads a registry a
/// concurrent writer may have changed), `ProjectTemplateInstaller`'s
/// registration, `ProjectTemplateUninstaller`'s row removal,
/// `RemoteRestoreService`'s path re-anchor, and the two guarded sidecars
/// (`MiniAppGrantStore`, `SessionAttributionService`) on their own lock
/// files. Every one of those is a synchronous, `nonisolated` frame: the
/// reentrancy below is thread-local, so a hold must never span an `await`.
///
/// **The sidecars, and what is NOT serialised (DI-M4).** The grants file
/// and the session→project map are the same whole-file RMW shape, so the
/// macOS/iOS writers take this lock at their own `mutate` chokepoints —
/// cheap, since it lives next door — which removes same-machine
/// attribution loss. What remains last-write-wins BY CONSTRUCTION is a
/// second DEVICE: an iPhone and a Mac pointed at one remote `~/.hermes`
/// hold their locks in their own Application Support directories and
/// cannot see each other, so the later write of an interleaved pair wins
/// whole-file and the earlier device's grant or attribution is gone.
/// Serialising that needs a create-exclusive primitive ON the remote over
/// SSH, whose stale-lock story across a flaky cellular link is worse than
/// the loss it would prevent. Stated, not half-built — and both sidecars
/// are recoverable by construction (a dropped grant re-prompts, a dropped
/// attribution is re-derived), which is why the registry also gets
/// `expecting:` and they do not.
