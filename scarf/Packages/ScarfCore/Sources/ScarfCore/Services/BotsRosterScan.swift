///
/// - roster order is `default` first, then valid named ids sorted — the
///   ordering is applied in Swift on both paths, from the same
///   `HermesProfileScope.isValidName` filter, so the shell's glob order and
///   locale collation never reach it;
/// - only directories count (`[ -d ]` follows symlinks, matching
///   `transport.stat(...)?.isDirectory`);
/// - a `profile.yaml` that is absent, larger than `maxProfileYAMLBytes`, or
///   not valid UTF-8 yields the same empty identity as a missing one, matching
///   `readBoundedText` returning nil — and `PRESENT`/`ABSENT` is carried as an
///   explicit flag so an empty-but-present file is never confused with either;
/// - a malformed `profile.yaml` still yields a row (Hermes' own
///   `read_profile_meta` swallows every exception so one bad file cannot empty
///   `hermes profile list`; `HermesBotProfileYAML.parse` does the same).
///
/// ## Refusing rather than degrading
///
/// Every failure mode here ends in `nil` from ``parse(_:rootHome:)`` — no
/// `base64` on the host, a truncated stream, a non-zero exit — and `nil` means
/// the caller runs the per-file path. That matters: quietly reporting "no
/// `profile.yaml`" for a profile that has one would render a configured bot as
/// an unmanaged profile, which is worse than being slow. The `OK` sentinel is
/// what makes truncation detectable at all.
