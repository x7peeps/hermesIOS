/// Process-wide, per-server cache for the `hermes --version` probe.
///
/// Before this existed, every consumer that needed the host's Hermes version
/// spawned its own `--version` subprocess: `HermesCapabilitiesStore` on each
/// store init, `ProjectTemplateInstaller` on every template install,
/// `FleetApplyExecutor` on every fleet apply. Nothing was shared and nothing
/// survived a relaunch, so a cold launch always painted capability-gated UI
/// as "unknown" (= hidden) until an unbounded subprocess answered — and a
/// transient probe failure silently blanked every gated surface.
///
/// This type collapses all of that into **one probe per server connection**:
///
/// - **Dedup.** Concurrent async callers for the same server join a single
///   in-flight `Task`; later callers hit the in-memory result.
/// - **Persistence.** A successful probe writes its raw version line to
///   `UserDefaults`, keyed by a *connection fingerprint* (see `key(for:)`).
///   The next launch can seed capability UI optimistically from that
///   last-known value while the fresh probe runs, then reconcile.
/// - **Graceful failure.** A failed probe is never cached and never
///   persisted, so a host that comes back later is re-probed rather than
///   pinned to a bogus answer.
///
/// **Only successful probes are cached.** A `.empty` (undetected) result is
/// deliberately *not* memoized: caching "I couldn't tell" would turn a
/// momentary PATH hiccup into a session-long capability blackout.
///
/// Thread-safety: a plain `NSLock` around two dictionaries. The probe itself
/// runs outside the lock, so a slow SSH round-trip to one host never blocks
/// a cache read for another.
