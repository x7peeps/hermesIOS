/// - the canonical record `<root>/.scarf/project.json` (agent-writable),
/// - the directories actually on disk.
///
/// They drift because agents hand-write two of the three. `diagnose()`
/// compares them and reports; `repair(_:)` fixes only what an EXISTING
/// idempotent writer can fix — `ProjectStore.save` / `derive` /
/// `indexInRegistry`, `ProjectDashboardService.saveRegistry`. The doctor
/// owns no write path of its own, so a repair can never do something the
/// rest of the app cannot already do, and re-running it is always a no-op.
///
/// **Never rewrites an agent-owned file.** A malformed `dashboard.json`,

/// candidates` transport calls: two registry reads (decoded, then raw, to
/// tell an invalid id from an absent one), five per row (root, record, three
