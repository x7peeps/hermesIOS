/// Replaces `?` placeholders in a SQL string with SQLite-escaped
/// literal values, in order. Used by `RemoteSQLiteBackend` because
/// the `sqlite3` CLI doesn't accept `?`-bound parameters on the
/// command line — it would need stdin `.parameter set @name` dot-
/// commands, which require a multi-line script for every query and
/// add round-trip overhead with no upside for our use case.
///
/// **Trust model — read this before adding a caller.** This is a literal
/// encoder for in-tree callers, **NOT** a general SQL-injection defense.
/// Do not extend the data-service surface with a method that inlines raw
/// untrusted input without validating it upstream first. The local backend
/// skips inlining entirely (`sqlite3_bind_*`), so this is the remote path
/// only.
///
/// The accepted param sources are integers (`limit`, `before`,
/// `since.timeIntervalSince1970`), Hermes-internal ids (UUID-shaped
/// session/tool ids that came back out of this same DB), and search text
/// that has been through `sanitizeFTSQuery`.
///
/// One caller is NOT on that list, and it is worth being precise about
/// why it is nevertheless safe rather than filing it under "accepted
/// sources": the v0.21.1 LIKE fallback inlines the user's search TERMS
/// verbatim. It escapes them only for LIKE's own wildcards (`%`, `_`,
/// `\`) — that is a matching concern and buys no safety at all. What
/// makes those terms inert is entirely `encodeText(_:)` below: every
/// single quote is DOUBLED, so a term can never close the literal it sits
/// in, and every C0 control character (newline included) is lifted out
/// into `char(<n>)` concatenation, so a term can never terminate the
/// remote heredoc that carries the statement. A term is therefore always
/// one SQL string constant, whatever it contains. Any future change to
/// `encodeText` has to preserve both of those properties, or that caller
/// stops being safe.
///
/// Escape rules mirror SQLite's literal syntax:
/// * `.null` → `NULL`
/// * `.integer(n)` → `<n>` (no quoting)
/// * `.real(d)` → `%.17g`-formatted (round-trips Double via decimal)
/// * `.text(s)` → `'<s with single-quotes doubled>'`, with newlines and the
///   other C0 controls split out into `char(<n>)` concatenation so a value
///   can never terminate the remote heredoc (see ``encodeText(_:)``)
/// * `.blob(d)` → `X'<hex>'`
