/// The bidirectional line-oriented transport that `ACPClient` speaks
/// JSON-RPC over. Abstracts away whether the other end is a local
/// `hermes acp` subprocess (macOS) or a remote SSH exec channel (iOS via
/// Citadel in M4+). ACPClient never touches `Process`, `Pipe`, file
/// descriptors, or SSH sessions directly — it just sends and receives
/// newline-delimited JSON lines over one of these.
///
/// **Line framing.** Senders pass a JSON object serialized to a single
/// line (no embedded `\n`). The channel appends the terminator itself.
/// The receiver yields one complete JSON line per `incoming` element;
/// partial lines are buffered internally until a newline arrives.
///
/// **Lifecycle.** A channel is "already live" when you hold a reference —
/// the constructor (or channel-factory call) spawns the subprocess / opens
/// the SSH exec channel. `close()` tears down and causes `incoming` /
/// `stderr` to finish. After `close()`, `send(_:)` throws.
///
/// **Errors.** Transport errors (broken pipe, SSH disconnect, process
/// died) surface as an error-terminated `incoming` stream — consumers
/// should be prepared for that, not just for clean `.finished` stream
/// termination. `send(_:)` also throws on these.
