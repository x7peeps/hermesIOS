/// Per-host circuit breaker for outbound SSH connection attempts (gh#138).
///
/// **Why this exists.** Every SSH invocation goes through the user's real
/// `~/.ssh/config`, and a `ProxyCommand` there can have side effects well
/// beyond a TCP dial — Cloudflare Zero Trust's `cloudflared access ssh`
/// opens a browser OAuth tab on every fresh connection attempt, hardware
/// or Secretive agents prompt for a touch, jump hosts can trigger MFA.
/// Scarf's background pollers (remote file watcher every 3s, connection
/// status every 15s) retry a dead connection forever, so an expired Zero
/// Trust session overnight meant thousands of browser tabs.
///
/// **What it does.** Tracks consecutive connection-level failures per host.
/// After `failureThreshold` failures the gate *opens*: callers are rejected
/// instantly (no ssh process spawned, so no ProxyCommand side effects)
/// until a backoff delay elapses. Then exactly one caller is admitted as a
/// probe — claiming the probe slot pushes `nextAllowed` forward so
/// concurrent callers stay rejected while it runs. A successful probe
/// closes the gate and everything resumes at full speed; a failed probe
/// doubles the delay (capped at `maxDelay`).
///
/// Only *connection-level* failures count (ssh exit 255, launch timeout).
/// A remote command that runs and exits non-zero proves the connection is
/// alive and resets the counter.
///
/// Thread-safe via an internal lock; `shared` is the app-wide instance.
/// Tests construct their own and drive time through the `now:` parameters.
