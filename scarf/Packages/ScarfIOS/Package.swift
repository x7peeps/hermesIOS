// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// iOS-specific support library: Keychain-backed key storage,
// UserDefaults-backed server config, Citadel-backed SSH connection
// testing + key generation. Consumed by the `scarf-ios` app target.
//
// Not built on Linux CI — Citadel's runtime is Apple-only, and
// `Security.framework` (for iOS Keychain) ships in the Apple SDKs
// only. The testable state-machine logic for onboarding lives in
// `ScarfCore/Security/` so Linux `swift test` still exercises the
// core transitions via `MockSSHConnectionTester` and
// `InMemorySSHKeyStore`.
