Format facts VERIFIED against Hermes v0.21.0 on this machine (charter C5), not from release notes: `hermes mcp add --help` prints `hermes mcp add [-h] [--url URL] [--command MCP_COMMAND] [--args ...] [--auth {oauth,header}] [--preset PRESET] [--connect-timeout N] [--env [ENV ...]] name`, exactly matching `HermesMCPAdd.stdioPlan`. A real emitted stdio entry (`~/.hermes/profiles/scarfbox-*/config.yaml`) is `mcp_servers:` → `  <name>:` → `    command:` scalar, `    args:` list, `    timeout:`, `    connect_timeout:`.

## Observations
- [fact] There is NO `mcpServers` JSON file. Hermes's MCP config is a top-level `mcp_servers:` YAML block (snake_case) inside `<home>/config.yaml` (`HermesPathSet.configYAML`), and `home` follows `active_profile` — so a per-profile Hermes has its own server list. `HermesFileService` reads it with a hand-rolled indent-sensitive line scanner and writes it with a line-level patcher that preserves comments, ordering and unmodelled keys; there are no Codable structs and no YAML library anywhere on that path. #hermes #config
- [decision] `ProjectsMCPRegistrar` (Mac target) registers `scarf-projects` unconditionally at every launch, off-main on a detached task — Alan's call: no settings toggle, it is a first-class part of Scarf. LOCAL contexts only; an SSH context is skipped because the bundled binary is a Mach-O for this Mac, and remote hosts keep the skill fallback. #mcp #decision
- [decision] CREATION goes through `hermes mcp add` (the argv Scarf already ships and has verified against the real argparse), never a hand-written YAML entry. RE-POINTING after the app moves uses a new `HermesFileService.setMCPServerCommand`, mirroring `setMCPServerCwd` through `patchMCPServerField` — remove-and-re-add would discard the user's own tool filters, timeouts and env on that entry. The command is quoted via `yamlScalar` because a bundle path can contain a space ("Scarf Dev.app"). #hermes
- [constraint] The launch pass is IDEMPOTENT: an entry already pointing at this binary writes nothing at all, because Hermes watches its own config and a rewrite per launch is churn a running agent sees. An entry of the same name that is NOT a stdio server (a user's own URL server squatting the name) is left untouched. #gotcha
- [gotcha] The helper is copied into `Scarf.app/Contents/Helpers` by a `PBXCopyFilesBuildPhase` (dstSubfolderSpec 1 + dstPath `Contents/Helpers`, CodeSignOnCopy) and the registrar resolves `Contents/Helpers` then `Contents/MacOS`. A build with no helper (or a non-executable path) is a documented SKIP, never an error dialog — registering a command Hermes cannot spawn would leave a broken entry the user has to find and delete. #build

## R2: the patcher fails closed, backs up, and verifies independently

t-1a1a9ce3. The line-based patcher's failure mode was never "one value goes wrong" — it was `config.yaml` as a whole, on a file Hermes watches, rewritten by the app that runs this on every launch.

- [decision] **`patchMCPServerField` gates the entry before mutating** (`unpatchableReason`): entry header at indent 2, the entry's own keys at exactly indent 4, deeper lines at 6+, spaces only, and no block scalars (`|`/`>`), anchors, aliases, merge keys or flow mappings. All of it is legal YAML that Hermes reads fine — the gate is not judging the file, it is knowing when we are out of our depth. Worst case before: an entry indented 3 got a hardcoded 4-space line inserted, giving one mapping two indentations, which is a parse error for the WHOLE file. #dataloss
- [gotcha] The tab check runs over the whole `mcp_servers` block, before the entry is located, because indent is counted in SPACES everywhere here — a tab-indented line reads as indent 0, ends the entry early, and hides the very lines that made the file unpatchable. Same reason `extractMCPBlock` now treats "top level" as *no leading whitespace of any kind* rather than "no leading spaces". Consequence, accepted: one tab anywhere in the block refuses every patch of every entry.
- [decision] **Backup + independent verification + restore.** One timestamped `config.yaml.scarf-backup-<stamp>` per launch, taken before the first mutating patch (per launch, not per patch — the point is what the user had before Scarf touched anything today). After writing, the file is RE-READ off disk and checked by `verifyPatchedConfig`, which shares no code with `parseMCPServersBlock`: the entry-name list must be unchanged, the patched entry must still pass the shape gate, and caller-declared `expecting:` lines must be present. Any failure restores the in-memory original (more reliable than the backup file) and returns false. Re-verifying with the parser that produced the edit would only prove the parser is self-consistent.
- [gotcha] `hermes mcp list` (a real verb, v0.21.0, argv verified per charter C5) was considered for that read-back and REJECTED: it TRUNCATES the command column (`/private/tmp/claude-501/-...`), so it cannot confirm the one value we care about, and it costs a subprocess on a launch path. The structural re-parse answers the question that actually matters after a surgical edit. #cli
- [gotcha] **Parser hardening, all of it storm-related.** `CharacterSet.whitespaces` does NOT contain `\r`, so every `hasSuffix(":")` test failed on a CRLF config, the entry became invisible, and the registrar shelled a 90-second `hermes mcp add` on EVERY launch forever. Fixed via `trimYAMLLine` (whitespacesAndNewlines) throughout the YAML region, plus quoted entry keys (`"scarf-projects":`) and inline comments (`command: /x  # ours` parsed the comment as part of the path → a re-point every launch that never converged). A replaced line preserves the file's `\r`.
- [gotcha] `yamlScalar` escapes `\\` and `\"` when it quotes; `unquote` used to strip the quotes and stop, so `/a\b` became `/a\\b` one save later and again the save after — a permanent "the command moved". They are now inverses (double-quoted undoes `\\`/`\"`/`\n`/`\r` and — since P32 gave `YAMLScalar.doubleQuoted` a control-character arm, because a RAW C0/C1 control makes PyYAML's reader refuse the document in every quoting style — also `\t`, `\xNN` and `\uNNNN`; other escapes are still left alone; single-quoted handles `''`).
- [decision] An interior space needs NO quoting — a plain YAML scalar carries it fine — and `yamlScalar` deliberately leaves it alone rather than churning quotes into the user's file. The test that claimed to assert quoting was renamed to assert the round-trip it actually checks.
- [decision] **Registrar: a config Scarf cannot manage is retried only when it changes.** `UnmanageableMarker` persists SHA-256 over `config.yaml` bytes PLUS the binary path we would register; a match short-circuits `ensureRegistered` before any spawn. Content-keyed so the user editing the file retries automatically with no state to reset; path-keyed so a Sparkle update or a move to /Applications un-latches a failure that was never the file's fault. The `hermes mcp add` branch re-reads the fingerprint AFTER the CLI runs — that process can rewrite the config even on a non-zero exit, and recording the pre-spawn hash would put the 90-second spawn straight back on every launch.
- [gotcha] Dev-copy detection matched only the literal `-dev.app/`, so `/Applications/scarf-dev-next.app` (which exists on the maintainer's Mac alongside `scarf-dev.app` and `scarf.app`) re-pointed `command` at itself every launch while the installed app re-pointed it back — a rewrite war on a watched file. Now matched on "dev" as a whole token in the BUNDLE NAME (`devBundleName`). Bundle id cannot tell them apart: `build-detached.sh` keeps `com.scarf.app` on purpose so iCloud keeps working.



## R3: `oauth:` is a block Scarf only PARTIALLY models (v0.21.1)

v0.21.1 added `mcp_servers.<name>.oauth.flow: browser|device`. It is the first key Scarf writes inside a nested block whose siblings it does not model.

- [decision] `setMCPServerOAuthFlow` uses `replaceOrInsertNestedScalar(block:key:value:)`, which touches exactly one child line at indent 6 inside an indent-4 block header and leaves every sibling byte-identical. The `replaceOrInsert<Block>` family (`identity_header`, `tools`) rebuilds its block from Scarf's model and is only safe for a block Scarf models COMPLETELY — `oauth:` carries `client_id`, `client_secret`, `scope` and `timeout`, so a block writer there is silent credential loss. #dataloss
- [gotcha] Clearing the flow when it is the block's only child removes the `oauth:` HEADER too. An `oauth:` line with nothing under it is a YAML null, which Hermes reads differently from an absent block. Pinned by `HermesMCPOAuthFlowTests`.
- [gotcha] `oauthFlow` is modelled as `String?`, not an enum: `mcp_config.py:639-641` rejects anything outside `{browser, device}`, but keeping the raw string means an unknown future spelling round-trips instead of collapsing to a default. The two UI surfaces clamp instead — the editor picker offers ""/browser/device and the login sheet's initial selection falls back to `browser` for anything unrecognized.
