The macOS app ships privacy-first usage analytics via the swift-stats package (github.com/awizemann/swift-stats, SaaS backend api.swiftstats.co). iOS will use a SEPARATE write key, not yet integrated.

**Key management (Phase 1, updated 2026-08-26): NOT hardcoded, NOT read from source at all.** The write key reaches the binary only through build settings: gitignored `scarf/Configs/SwiftStatsLocal.xcconfig` (`SWIFT_STATS_WRITE_KEY`) → committed `scarf/Configs/SwiftStats.xcconfig` (empty default, then `#include?`) → target build configs → Info.plist key `SwiftStatsWriteKey` → runtime read in `Analytics.writeKey`, validated by `Analytics.validWriteKey` (rejects nil/empty/whitespace/an unexpanded `$(` — any of those disables analytics for the process, never falls back to a stale key). The canonical rotated key lives in Keychain vendor **`swift-stats-write-key`**; the previously leaked hardcoded key is being revoked. The key must NEVER appear in source or in any committed file. Practical consequence: a release build archived without `SwiftStatsLocal.xcconfig` present ships with analytics silently off.

**Consent configuration (updated 2026-09-14):** `Analytics.consent` grants `[.usage, .diagnostics, .identity]` (`.all`). The `.identity` group was added to enable a stable random UUID per install so retention counts are real — without it the SDK minted a fresh install id per session, making the Retention page unreadable. The install id is hashed (SHA256(uuid + installIdSalt)) and is one install, not a person: no cross-device or cross-app identity, and `userId` is never sent (Scarf never calls `identify()`). The SDK persists consent in its defaults suite (`com.wizemann.stats.com.scarf.app`), so `StatsUsageTracker` applies the grant via `setConsent` during bootstrap — an install that first ran under the older grant would otherwise keep it forever. `StatsUsageTracker.bootstrap` is a Task that awaits before any lifecycle signal or first event, ordering the consent grant strictly before install-id minting.

**Architecture (updated 2026-09-02 — bot lifecycle events added; updated 2026-09-14 — consent and bootstrap refactored):**
1. `scarf/scarf/Core/Services/UsageEvent.swift` — closed `nonisolated enum` (32 cases) that IS the taxonomy: every case's associated values are closed prop-vocabulary enums or bucket structs (`DurationBucket`, `ServerCountBucket`, `SkillCountBucket`, `SettingKeyToken`) whose only initializer runs a vetted bucketing/sanitizing helper. `name`/`props` reproduce the pre-refactor string wire format byte-for-byte (`UsageEventWireFormatTests` is the acceptance test). Nested `Outcome` enum expanded to include `.unconfirmed` (neither confirmed nor refused — exit 0 with no success line and no refusal marker), tracking verdicts from `HermesCLIOutcome.Confidence` to separate real refusals from silent dispatches (series break P40b).
2. `scarf/scarf/Core/Services/UsageTracking.swift` — `UsageTracking` protocol (`record(_:)`, `recordOnce(_:key:)`, plus `record(rawName:props:)` reserved for the ScarfCore bridge only), `StatsUsageTracker.shared` (production, owns the single StatsClient, appId com.scarf.app, installIdSalt "scarf-macos-2026" — NEVER change the salt), `NoopUsageTracker`, and shared lock-guarded `UsageOnceKeys` dedupe. `resetRecordedOnceForTesting()` is gone — dedupe now lives per tracker instance. Bootstrap task gates all client access to ensure consent is granted before the first lifecycle signal.
3. `scarf/scarf/Core/Services/Analytics.swift` — now a thin, lock-guarded forwarder over an installable `Analytics.tracker` seam (default `StatsUsageTracker.shared`). App call sites are unchanged (`Analytics.record(...)`) but take a `UsageEvent`. Tests swap the seam via `Analytics.install(_:)`; `scarfTests/CapturingUsageTracker.swift` is the test double. No-ops under XCTest/previews (isSyntheticHost) and when disabled. isPreRelease=true for DEBUG/dev-detached builds. Master opt-out toggle in Settings → Advanced ("Usage Analytics", default on).
4. `scarf/Packages/ScarfCore/Sources/ScarfCore/Diagnostics/ScarfAnalytics.swift` — injectable process-wide recorder seam, **deliberately still string-based** (comment on `Analytics.CoreBridge` explains why: ScarfCore can't see the app target and so can't name a `UsageEvent`; duplicating a second closed enum there would let the taxonomy fork). **ScarfCore must NEVER import Stats** (shared with iOS). macOS installs a bridge (`Analytics.CoreBridge`) in scarfApp.init; iOS installs nothing → no-op. `durationBucket`/`toolCallCountBucket` helpers live here so both sides bucket identically.
5. `scarf/scarf/Core/Services/StatsScarfMonBackend.swift` — ScarfMonBackend emitting perf_measure only for over-budget interval samples, rate-capped 30/category/process; installed via AppScarfMonBoot alongside (not replacing) signpost/logger backends.

**Event taxonomy sections (32 cases):** Launch/lifecycle (5: bootstrapTaskFailed, deepLinkOpened, firstRun, launchCompleted, skillsBootstrapped), Hermes control (1: hermesControlAction), Servers/connection (7: serverAdded, serverRemoved, connectAttempted, connectSucceeded, connectFailed, reconnectAttempted, reconnectSucceeded), Updates (1: updateCheckCompleted), Settings/navigation (3: settingChanged, notificationToggled, sectionViewed), Chat (6: chatSessionStarted, messageSent, modelPreflightResult, sessionResumeFallback, permissionPromptResponded, voiceUsed), Projects/templates (3: projectCreated, templateInstalled, skillInstalled), Bots (5: botCreated, botUpdated, botRemoved, botRoutineAction, botPeerAction — added 2026-09-02), Diagnostics (1: perfMeasure).

**Accepted deviations from cross-app swift-stats conventions (decisions, not TODOs):** keep event name `section_viewed` (not the cross-app `view_shown`; no `via` prop); no `error_shown` event (failures tracked at the operation layer, e.g. `connect_failed`, `agent_turn_failed`); keep `autoEvents: [.appOpen, .appBackground, .sessions]` including `.appBackground` (macOS has no true background state, so it's the closest analogue to the package's session-gap logic). Full rationale in documents/analytics/swift-stats-adoption-event-taxonomy.md.

**Event conventions (why: swift-stats validates and drops violations; privacy is the design center):**
- snake_case names; flat string props from CLOSED vocabularies only — never user text, hostnames, usernames, paths, URLs, session/project names, setting values, or raw error strings. Map errors via case-only switches (e.g. `analyticsErrorKind` in TransportErrors.swift).
- Durations/counts as coarse bucket enums; emit state TRANSITIONS and once-per-turn/process latches, never polling ticks.
- Tests: app-target facade no-ops under XCTest, so app-side tests assert pure decision logic; ScarfCore seam tests use a captured recorder and MUST nest under one `.serialized` parent suite (process-global recorder) with `defer { install(nil) }`.
- Taxonomy + accepted deviations: documents/analytics/swift-stats-adoption-event-taxonomy.md. Privacy manifest declares Product Interaction + Other Diagnostic Data; `identify()` is never called (no User ID declaration).

Landed as commits 8d1c5dc, 7887687, 453465a, 9bc58c4, abdd0e7, e5d393a plus audit-fix commit (Aug 2026) and bot lifecycle events (9726944, Sept 2026). Consent configuration and bootstrap refactored Sept 2026. Deployment target was bumped 14.6 → 15.0 for the package.

## Observations
- [fact] ScarfCore must never import Stats; analytics from ScarfCore goes through the ScarfAnalytics injectable seam, installed only by the macOS app #architecture
- [fact] installIdSalt "scarf-macos-2026" must never change — changing it re-identifies every install as new #constraint
- [fact] Consent grants `.identity` so the SDK keeps one stable random UUID per install (hashed as SHA256(uuid + installIdSalt)); SDK persists this in its defaults suite so `StatsUsageTracker` reapplies it at bootstrap to prevent drift #architecture
- [fact] StatsUsageTracker.bootstrap is a Task that gates all client access, ordered before the first lifecycle signal so install-id minting runs under the granted consent #architecture
- [fact] Outcome enum includes `.unconfirmed` for Hermes gateway actions that neither confirmed nor refused (exit 0 with no success line); distinguishes from `.failed` verdicts (series break P40b) #taxonomy
- [fact] App-target tests capture emitted events by installing CapturingUsageTracker via Analytics.install; every suite that installs into the process-wide seam must share one .serialized parent #testing
- [fact] The write key is never in source; it reaches the binary via gitignored scarf/Configs/SwiftStatsLocal.xcconfig → committed SwiftStats.xcconfig → Info.plist SwiftStatsWriteKey → Analytics.writeKey; canonical copy lives in Keychain vendor swift-stats-write-key #security
- [fact] UsageEvent (scarf/scarf/Core/Services/UsageEvent.swift) is a closed 32-case enum that IS the taxonomy, enforced by the type checker via UsageTracking seam #architecture
