## Observations
- [catalog] Localizable.xcstrings is the source of truth; per-locale JSONs live in tools/translations/<locale>.json (key = English source string, value = translation). Omitted keys fall back to English at runtime — use that for proper nouns (Scarf, Hermes, Anthropic, OAuth, SSH) and technical terms #catalog
- [merge] tools/merge-translations.py merges JSON files into Localizable.xcstrings; LOCALES list in that script gates which locales are processed #tooling
- [rule] Preserve format specifiers exactly: %@, %lld, %d. Use positional forms (%1$@, %2$lld) when word order needs to change #rule
- [step] Adding a locale: add to knownRegions in project.pbxproj, add JSON in tools/translations/, add to LOCALES in merge script, translate InfoPlist.xcstrings (mic permission), spot-check Dashboard/Chat/Settings in Xcode App Language #howto
- [gotcha] English stem+suffix plural-hack keys (any key with a letter directly before %@, e.g. "%lld skill%@", "%lld entr%@" — code substitutes English suffixes like "s"/"y"/"ies" into %@; 10 such keys as of v2.22.0) must NOT be translated; leave them out of the locale JSONs so they fall back to English #rule
- [gotcha] Headless xcodebuild never merges newly extracted keys into Localizable.xcstrings — only an interactive Xcode IDE build does; run one before translating new strings #tooling
- [reference] Deeper context: scarf/docs/I18N.md #docs

- [rule] **Shared components must take `LocalizedStringKey`, never `String`.** A `String` property binds `Text`'s VERBATIM overload, so nothing routed through the component is ever extracted — that silently made ~146 call sites of `ScarfPageHeader`/`ScarfSectionHeader`/`ScarfTextField`/`ScarfBadge` unlocalizable (go/no-go blocking condition 6, fixed in be4f27d). Take `LocalizedStringKey` and add an explicit `verbatim:` initializer for runtime-computed text (`init(verbatim:)`, `init(verbatim:verbatimSubtitle:)`); literal call sites are source-compatible, and only genuinely dynamic ones need the label. Same trap as `.accessibilityLabel(someStringVariable)` #rule #i18n
- [gotcha] `subtitle.map(Text.init)` does NOT compile for a `LocalizedStringKey?` — overload resolution picks `Text.init<S: StringProtocol>`. Write `subtitle.map { Text($0) }` #gotcha


- [tooling] Under headless xcodebuild, `.stringsdata` build intermediates are the authoritative extraction oracle: JSON per source file (Build/Intermediates.noindex/<target>.build/<config>/.../Objects-normal/<arch>/) listing every extractable key with file:line. Diff their union (both app targets) against Localizable.xcstrings to find missing keys mechanically — then add keys to the catalog JSON directly (since headless builds never merge). Used for the post-v2.24 backfill (+489 keys) #tooling
- [rule] Two plural-hack keys are deliberately translated ("%lld delivery failure%@", "Applied to %lld host%@") — allow-listed in scarfTests/LocalizationCatalogTests.swift, which also pins specifier parity, untranslated hack keys, and no-empty-translations. Do not grow the allow-list; they're the first candidates for real .stringsdict plurals #rule
- [gotcha] Use the curly apostrophe (U+2019, "Couldn’t…") in catalog keys — a straight-apostrophe variant of the same sentence creates a duplicate key with 6 duplicated translations (happened with "Couldn't save %@: %@", deduped post-v2.24) #gotcha


- [rule] "Zero missing localizations" is the WRONG target — the catalog is designed so omitted keys fall back to English, and ~108 keys (of 2165) are deliberately English in some or all locales. Three legitimate hole categories, and only three: (1) the 18 English stem+suffix plural-hack keys, (2) keys with no translatable words once specifiers are stripped (`"—"`, `"%@: %@"`, `"×%lld"`; 31 keys), (3) an explicit 59-key English-fallback list — proper nouns/product names (Docker, Daytona, Singularity, OAuth, SOUL.md, MCP), CLI/config literals the user types verbatim (`npx`, `oauth`, `supports_parallel_tool_calls`), sample values and URL placeholders. Anything else missing a locale is a real gap #rule
- [tooling] `tools/validate-catalog.py` is the mechanical gate: schema round-trip, specifier parity, `state: "translated"` + non-empty, and coverage against those three categories. `--list-fallbacks` prints category 3, which must stay identical to `englishFallbackKeys` in scarfTests/LocalizationCatalogTests.swift (`everyTranslatableKeyIsLocalized` + `fallbackListIsCurrent` pin both directions, so a fallback key that later gets translated fails the build rather than silently hiding a gap) #tooling
- [gotcha] Deciding whether a partly-missing key is a gap or a fallback: look at what the OTHER locales already do for that key. If every sibling value is byte-identical to the English source, it's a fallback — leave it. If siblings genuinely translated it, the missing locale is a real gap. This diff also catches mistranslated proper nouns: `Singularity` (the container runtime, TerminalTab.swift beside Docker/Daytona) had been rendered "Singularidad"/"Singularidade" in es/pt-BR; both were dropped so it falls back like its siblings #gotcha
- [tooling] `.stringsdata` extraction needs BOTH app targets built, and a headless incremental `xcodebuild` will NOT refresh them for files it didn't recompile. Build `-scheme scarf` (macOS) and `-scheme "scarf mobile" -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'` before diffing, or iOS-only strings silently look "missing" #tooling



- [rule] The `LocalizedStringKey` component rule is now **app-wide, not just ScarfDesign** (section-audit F7, 2026-09-02). Same trap, three more shapes: (a) a `String` param on any shared row/card component — SettingsComponents alone made 133/155 Settings labels unextractable; (b) a `String`-returning property on a **ScarfCore** type, which can NEVER be extracted because that package has no catalog (localize app-side, one sentence per enum case, and mark the ScarfCore property as an English token in its doc comment); (c) an English noun interpolated into a localized frame (`"Allowed \(kind.pluralNoun)"` → `"Allowed %@"`), unusable in any inflecting language. Escape hatches: `init(verbatim:)`, `verbatimLabel:`, `verbatimReason:` — put the escaped param FIRST so a call site can't drift back onto the localized init #rule #i18n
- [rule] Plural hacks are retired via **automatic grammar agreement** (`^[\(n) incident](inflect: true)`), not String Catalog plural variations: the catalog has zero `variations` entries, tools/translations is flat key→string, and validate-catalog.py assumes `stringUnit`. Keep the markup for de/es/fr/pt-BR; DROP it for ja/zh-Hans (no plural agreement). Delete the old hack key from the catalog — an unused stale key reads as translated while the live site renders the new one. 18 → 11 hack keys after F7; the two deliberate exceptions are unchanged #rule
- [gotcha] `.stringsdata` lives under the DerivedData directory for THIS project path — find it with `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings | grep OBJROOT`. A sibling worktree's DerivedData holds identically-named files whose `source` points elsewhere; diffing those reports "0 missing" and looks like success #tooling
- [gotcha] `tools/merge-translations.py` only writes keys that ALREADY exist in Localizable.xcstrings. Insert new keys into the catalog FIRST, then merge — otherwise everything lands in `unknown-keys-skipped` and the script exits 1 #tooling


- [gotcha] An interactive Xcode extraction run from the **macOS scheme alone DELETES keys whose only call sites are in the iOS target** — the 2026-09-08 pass (+425 keys) silently dropped `%lld prompt%@ queued — manage on the Mac app`, `ScarfGo`, `%@ (%lld)`, `%@. %@`, `%lld file%@`. Two were plural hacks, so `pluralHackSetIsNonEmpty` (>= 10) went red, and `ScarfGo` leaving the catalog broke `fallbackListIsCurrent` ("not in catalog") — two gate failures that look unrelated to the missing translations. Fix: diff `git show HEAD:scarf/scarf/Localizable.xcstrings` against the working copy and restore the removed entries verbatim (their translations come back with them); the alternative is extracting both schemes before translating #gotcha
- [tooling] **The catalog's on-disk format after an Xcode save is NOT what `merge-translations.py` writes.** Xcode emits `"key" : value` (space before the colon), empty objects as `{\n\n}`, and a file with **no trailing newline**; `json.dump(indent=2)` emits `"key": value` + newline, which rewrites all ~95k lines. When the working copy is Xcode-formatted, patch it with a small serializer that reproduces that style and preserves the existing key order (Xcode's sort is not codepoint order — `"—"` sorts near the top — so never re-sort), then mirror the same strings into `tools/translations/<locale>.json` for the merge tool. Verified byte-for-byte round-trip before writing #tooling
- [rule] Translating a fresh extraction: derive the authoritative missing list from the THREE legitimate hole categories in `scarfTests/LocalizationCatalogTests.swift` (read `englishFallbackKeys` straight out of the Swift source), not from raw locale coverage. Then self-audit mechanically — specifier multiset (positional prefixes stripped) equal between source and every translation, inflect markup present for de/es/fr/pt-BR and spelled out for ja/zh-Hans, and a base-vs-new diff proving no pre-existing translation changed value #rule


## iOS-only key pruning is now gated (2026-09-08)

- [rule] The six iOS-only catalog keys are pinned by `LocalizationCatalogTests.iosOnlyKeysAreStillInTheCatalog` (scarf/scarfTests/LocalizationCatalogTests.swift, list: `iosOnlyKeys`). A macOS-scheme extraction that prunes them now fails the scarf scheme's tests with the restore procedure in the failure message (restore verbatim from git). Building the iOS scheme does NOT protect them — confirmed twice (2026-09-08): the iOS scheme never writes back to the shared catalog, so iOS-only keys are hand-maintained. A key added for an iOS-only call site must be hand-added to the catalog AND appended to `iosOnlyKeys`.
