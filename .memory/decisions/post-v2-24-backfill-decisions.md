## Observations
- [decision] Capability-aware display defaults (tag-verified): checkpoints.enabled false at ALL supported tags (ungated), max_snapshots 20 from v0.13, delegation 250/10 from v0.20.2 (isV0202OrLater) — resolved via display*(capabilities:) sentinels; unknown version resolves to the older default #settings
- [gotcha] The v2.24.0 go/no-go board's floor claims (checkpoints v0.21, delegation v0.20.4) were BOTH wrong — charter C2 applies to internal audit boards too; only tagged Hermes source counts #capability-gating
- [gotcha] ACPClient is a reentrant actor — pre-await guards are not mutual exclusion; use in-flight task + generation counter, and stop() must never await an in-flight request #acp
- [fact] .stringsdata build intermediates are the authoritative string-extraction oracle under headless xcodebuild; diff them against Localizable.xcstrings #i18n
- [gotcha] Plural-hack key detection requires %lld AND letter-before-%@ conjoined; bare pattern falsely flags the v%@ version family #i18n
- [decision] Config-parity gate widened to all 26 config-writer files (AllConfigWritersParityTests); detection uses both legacy inline-argv patterns (guard against unseen `settig`/`config set` calls) AND GuardedTextFile label markers (label: "config.yaml") for direct-YAML writers; new writer files must register in knownWriters — catches undiscovered writers immediately #config-parity
- [gotcha] ChatView.swift (Scarf iOS) was always writing model.provider/model.default but through hand-rolled shell, invisible until P39/P46 routed it through HermesConfigSet.argv/judge #config-parity
- [gotcha] MattermostSetupViewModel became a config writer (P51) when mattermost.require_mention moved off .env; MattermostSettings now carries requireMentionIsSet to distinguish absent key from resolved true #config-parity
